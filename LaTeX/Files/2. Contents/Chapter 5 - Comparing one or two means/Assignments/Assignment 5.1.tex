The maximum allowed amount of PFAS chemicals in soil is 0.9 microgram per kg of dry soil. In a regular soil check, researchers take 49 soil \concept{samples} in a town near a plastic factory and find a \concept{mean} PFAS level of 0.918 microgram/kg with a \concept{standard deviation} of 0.071. They want to show with 95\% confidence that the PFAS levels in the town are significantly above the norm. \\

The researchers want to quickly check another town near the plastic factory, but have less time available. They take 16 \concept{samples} in the second town and find a much higher \concept{mean} PFAS level of 0.930 microgram/kg with a comparable \concept{standard deviation} of 0.070. \\
