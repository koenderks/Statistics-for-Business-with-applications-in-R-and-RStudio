\section{Installing and setting up R and RStudio}

Before you can start to learn statistics using this workbook, it is required that you have installed both \texttt{R} and \texttt{RStudio} on your computer. \texttt{R} itself is just a bare-bones programming language, and can be hard to learn and navigate without guidance. \texttt{RStudio} is a shell around the \texttt{R} language which offers some guidance and visualizes most of the functionality that \texttt{R} generally hides for users.\\

\texttt{R} is open-source and can be downloaded free-of-charge from \url{https://cran.r-project.org}. While working through this workbook, you will not actually open this program at any time, but you are required to have it installed since it is the engine that RStudio runs on. \\

RStudio is a user-friendly coding environment that makes your life while working with \texttt{R} a little bit easier. RStudio can be freely downloaded from \url{https://rstudio.com}. This is the program that you will be using to write and run your own \texttt{R} code. \\
