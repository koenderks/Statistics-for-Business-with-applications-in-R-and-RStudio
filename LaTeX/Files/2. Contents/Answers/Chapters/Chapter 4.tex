\subsection{Chapter 4: Correlation and regression}

\answer{
    Two variables can either be positively related, not related, or negatively related. The most logical relationship is that the distance a customer lives from the store is negatively related to how many times they visit the store.
}

    \hspace*{.5cm} $\bar{x} = 3.001$ \hspace*{1cm} $\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y}) = -5.458$ \\

}

\answer{
    The covariance is negative. A negative covariance indicates that that as one variable deviates from the mean, the other variable deviates in the other direction. This means that, when a customerâ€™s distance from the store in kilometers is higher than the mean, their average visits per week will likely be lower than the mean.
}

\answer{
    The disadvantage of using the covariance as a measure for the strength of this relationship is that it depends on the measurement unit (kilometers vs. meters) that the co-worker asks the questions in. If the co-worker would have asked the question in meters the covariance would have increased by a 1000 times, namely -779.84.
}

\answer{
    $s_x = \sqrt{\frac{\sum^n_{i = 1} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}} = \sqrt{\frac{6.977}{7}} = 0.998$ \hspace*{2cm} $s_y = \sqrt{\frac{\sum^n_{i = 1} (y_i - \bar{y})^2}{n - 1}} = \sqrt{\frac{7}{7}} = 1$
}

\answer{
    $r_{xy} = \frac{s_{xy}}{s_x \times s_y} = \frac{-0.779}{0.998 \times 1} = -0.779$
}

\answer{
    The coefficient is -0.779, which represents is a relatively strong negative relationship.

    $z_{0.05} = -1.645$
}

\answer{
    $z_r = \frac{1}{2} \times log_e(\frac{1 + r}{1 - r}) = \frac{1}{2} \times log_e(\frac{1 - 0.779}{1 + 0.779}) = -1.043$ \\
    \\
    $SE_r = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n - 3}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{8 - 3}} = 0.447$ \\
    \\
    $z_{xy} = \frac{z_r}{SE_r} = \frac{-1.043}{0.447} = -2.33$
}

\answer{
    The observed z-value is more extreme (lower) than the critical z-value. $H_0$ is rejected with 95\% confidence. You can be 95\% confident that $\rho_{xy}$ is negative in the population. There is a 5\% change of a type-I error.

    The black line represents the normal distribution. The red line represents the t-distribution. The difference between the two distributions, in terms of their shape, is that the t-distribution has slightly thicker tails. When you increase the degrees of freedom of the t-distribution, it will start to look more like the normal distribution.\\

    $R^2 = 0.64$ \\
    \\
    Interpretation: The multiple $R^2$ is 0.64, meaning that 64\% of the variation in the number of milk cartons that are thrown away each day can be explained by the price of the milk cartons.

    $H_0$: $\beta_1 \leq 0$ \hspace*{4cm} $H_1$: $\beta_1 > 0$

\answer{
    The p-value for the regression coefficient is < 2e-16, which is lower than the significance level of 5\%. $H_0$ can be rejected with 95\% confidence. You can be 95\% sure that $\beta_1$ is positive in the population. The price contributes significantly to the average number of milk cartons thrown away. There is a 5\% risk of a type-I error.

\answer{
    The supermarket will throw away fewer cartons of milk. \\

    \underline{Explanation}: The current number of milk cartons thrown away (4) lies outside the bounds of the 90\% confidence interval for the prediction.
