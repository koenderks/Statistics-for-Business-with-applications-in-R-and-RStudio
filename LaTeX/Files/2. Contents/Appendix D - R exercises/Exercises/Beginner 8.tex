\subsection{Object types: Factors}

\beginnerexercise{
    Run the following code in \texttt{R}: \\
    \\
    \codeblock{g <- gl(4, 3)}
    Is \rcode{g} a vector? (If not, what is it?) How can you check?
}

\beginnerexercise{
    Run the following code in \texttt{R}: \\
    \\
    \codeblock{v <- rep(c(\textquotesingle m\textquotesingle, \textquotesingle f\textquotesingle), 3)}
    Encode the variable \rcode{v} as factor levels. How do you check whether you succeeded?
}

\beginnerexercise{
    Run the following code in \texttt{R}: \\
    \\
    \codeblock{x <- 0:10\%\%3}
    Convert \rcode{x} to a factor. How many factor levels has \rcode{x}?
}
