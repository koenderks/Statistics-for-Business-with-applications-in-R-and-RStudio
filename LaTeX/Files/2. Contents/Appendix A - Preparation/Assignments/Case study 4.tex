In this case study you may work in groups (max. 4 students) to perform a statistical analysis in \texttt{R}, and write a small report about the results in the form of a management note. For this case study you will need the data set \dataset{creditRating.csv} from the online resources. The case you will be working on this week is the following: \\

\textit{You and your team work for a large bank that has been recently criticized for lending too much loans to people who could not pay them back. In response, the bank has decided to design an algorithm that automatically gives new customers a credit rating, indicating whether they are likely to default on a loan they will potentially receive. To provide this credit rating, management has asked of your team to create a model to generate this credit rating on the basis of the customer's financial- and work situation. Your teams has access to a data set containing proper predictions from a different banking institution.} \\

Write a small (less than two page) report to the client's management where you provide your insights and recommendations. The report should describe your analysis and how you arrived at your conclusions. It should at least contain the following points: \\

\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\blacksquare$] A short introduction about the topic of the report and why it is relevant for the client.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] A description of each variable in the data set, including what it represents and what measurement level it is. 
    \item[$\blacksquare$] A visualization of the relationships in the data set. Discuss what you can learn from this figure.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] A formulation of the regression model, indicating what parameters you will investigate in the analysis.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] A linear regression predicting the credit rating of a person using the meaningful variables in the data set.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] A check of the assumptions of your regression analysis and a statement of whether these are violated.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] On the basis of the results, your answer to the question(s) posed by the client and an explanation of how you arrived at this answer.
\end{itemize}
