In this case study you may work in groups (max. 4 students) to perform a statistical analysis in \texttt{R}, and write a small report about the results in the form of a management note. For this case study you will need the data set \dataset{abTest.csv} from the online resources. The case you will be working on this week is the following: \\

\textit{You and your team work as a data analytic task force for a social media company. Your company is constantly testing different layouts for the company web page via an \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing}{A/B test}. In your current testing round, you are testing whether a green "Like" button on your web page generates more web traffic than the default blue "Like" button. Specifically, your company is interested in whether they should put the green button on the web page instead of the blue button.} \\

Write a small (less than two page) report to the client's management where you provide your insights and recommendations. The report should describe your analysis and how you arrived at your conclusions. It should at least contain the following points: \\

\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\blacksquare$] A short introduction about the topic of the report and why it is relevant for the client.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] A description of each variable in the data set, including what it represents and what measurement level it is.  
    \item[$\blacksquare$] A statistical formulation of the hypotheses that you intent to investigate, and what parameters are involved.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] What test you will be using to test these hypotheses. Also elaborate on whether the assumptions of the parametric variant of this test are violated and if so, what non-parametric test to use.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] A test of the mean return frequency for the users that saw the blue button against the mean return frequency for the users that saw the green button.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] On the basis of the results, your answer to the question(s) posed by the client and an explanation of how you arrived at this answer.
\end{itemize}
