In this case study you can work in groups (max. 4 students) to perform a statistical analysis in \texttt{R}, write a small report, and present the results to your client. For this case study you will need the data set \dataset{abTest.csv} from the online resources. The case you will be working on this week is the following: \\

\textit{Your team works as a data analytic task force for a social media company. Your company is constantly testing different layouts for the company web page via an \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing}{A/B test}. In your current A/B test, you want to determine whether a green "Like" button on your web page works better than the default blue "Like" button. Management is interested in whether they should put the green button on the web page instead of the blue button.} \\

Write a small report to the client's management where you give your insights and recommendations. The report should describe your analysis and how you arrived at your conclusions. It should at least contain the following points: \\

\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\blacksquare$] A short introduction about the reason and topic of the report.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] What the variables in the data set represent on a practical level and what their measurement level is. 
    \item[$\blacksquare$] A statistical formulation of the hypotheses that you are investigating.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] What test you will be using to investigate these hypotheses. Also elaborate on whether the assumptions of the parametric variant of this test are violated and if so, what non-parametric test to use.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] A test of the mean return frequency in the blue group against the mean return frequency in the green group.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] On the basis of these results, your answer to the question(s) posed by the client's management.
\end{itemize}
