In this case study you may work in groups (max. 4 students) to perform a statistical analysis in \texttt{R}, write a small report, and present the results to your client. For this case study you will need the data sets \dataset{UNresolutions.csv}\footnote{These source of this data set is publicly available at \url{https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/LEJUQZ}.}, \dataset{US.csv} and \dataset{Russia.csv} from the online resources. The case you will be working on this week is the following: \\

\textit{You and your team are working for a consultancy agency that advises start-up businesses about financial opportunities. You have been hired by a startup business that has developed a technological innovation with applications in both the agriculture and health sectors. However, your client has an internal conflict between its two co-founders. One wants to introduce their innovative product in the US first and the other wants to introduce the product in Russia first. You have been hired to provide advice about whether the start-up should first go to Russia, or first go to the United States of America, and in what sector it is best to introduce their innovation. Due to the technological nature of their product, it is important for the client that, whatever country they settle in, expresses views that are in line with that of the United Nations.} \\

Write a small report to the client's management where you give your insights and recommendations. The report should describe your analysis and how you arrived at your conclusions. It should at least contain the following points: \\

\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\blacksquare$] A short introduction about the reason and topic of the report.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] A description of each variable in the \dataset{resolutions.csv} data set, including what it represents and what its measurement level is. 
    \item[$\blacksquare$] A figure that shows the amount of positive votes of the United States of America and the Russian Federation together, and over time.  Discuss what observations you can make from this figure.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] A figure that shows the average income per sector for the United States of America. Discuss what observations you can make from this figure.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] A figure that shows the average income per sector for the Russian federation. Discuss what observations you can make from this figure.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] On the basis of these results, your answer to the question(s) posed by the client's management.
\end{itemize}
