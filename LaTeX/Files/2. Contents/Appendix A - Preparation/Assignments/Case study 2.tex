In this case study you may work in groups (max. 4 students) to perform a statistical analysis in \texttt{R}, and write a small report about the results in the form of a management note. For this case study you will need the data sets \dataset{UNresolutions.csv}\footnote{These source of this data set is publicly available at \url{https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/LEJUQZ}.}, \dataset{US.csv} and \dataset{Russia.csv} from the online resources. The case you will be working on this week is the following: \\

\textit{You and your team are working for a consultancy agency that advises start-up businesses about financial opportunities. You have been hired by a start-up that has developed a technological innovation with applications in both the agriculture and health sectors. However, this client currently has an internal conflict between its two co-founders. The first wants to introduce their innovative product in the US before Russia, and the second wants to introduce the product in Russia before the US. The client is specifically interested in your opinion about whether the start-up should first go to Russia or first go to the US, and in what sector it is best to introduce their product. Due to the advanced technological nature of their product, it is important for the client that, whatever country they settle in, often expresses views that are in line with that of the United Nations, since these impose strict regulations on the market.} \\

Write a small (less than two page) report to the client's management where you provide your insights and recommendations. The report should describe your analysis and how you arrived at your conclusions. It should at least contain the following points: \\

\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\blacksquare$] A short introduction about the topic of the report and why it is relevant for the client.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] A description of each variable in the \dataset{resolutions.csv} data set, including what it represents and what measurement level it is.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] A figure that shows the amount of positive votes of the United States of America and the Russian Federation together, and over time. Discuss what observations you can make from this figure.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] A figure that shows the average income per sector for the United States of America. Discuss what observations you can make from this figure.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] A figure that shows the average income per sector for the Russian federation. Discuss what observations you can make from this figure.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] On the basis of the results, your answer to the question(s) posed by the client and an explanation of how you arrived at this answer.
\end{itemize}
