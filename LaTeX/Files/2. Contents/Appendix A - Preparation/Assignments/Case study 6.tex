In this case study you can work in groups (max. 4 students) to perform a statistical analysis in \texttt{R}, write a small report, and present the results to your client. For this case study you will need the data set \dataset{trial.csv}\footnote{This data set is featured in Field, A. P. (2013). \textit{Discovering Statistics Using IBM SPSS Statistics (4th ed.).} London: Sage.} from the online resources. The case you will be working on this week is the following: \\

\textit{Your team works for a research company that specializes in medial trials, and you have been asked to analyze the results of a trial about the effectiveness of Viagra. Three groups of men have been given different doses of Viagra, and their libido -and that of their partner- was measured over the course of one week. The researchers are interested in whether the Viagra treatment is related a higher libido than the placebo treatment.} \\

Write a small report to the client's management where you give your insights and recommendations. The report should describe your analysis and how you arrived at your conclusions. It should at least contain the following points: \\

\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\blacksquare$] A short introduction about the reason and topic of the report.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] What the variables in the data set represent on a practical level and what their measurement level is. 
    \item[$\blacksquare$] A visualization of the difference in means between the different doses.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] A formulation of the statistical null and alternative hypothesis that you will investigate.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] An ANOVA that tests your formulated null hypothesis.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] On the basis of your results, the answer to the question(s) posed by the researchers and an explanation of how you arrived at this answer.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] (optional) An extended analysis where you take into account the partner's libido, and an explanation of these results.
\end{itemize}
