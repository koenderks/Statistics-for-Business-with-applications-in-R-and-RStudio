In this case study you may work in groups (max. 4 students) to perform a statistical analysis in \texttt{R}, and write a small report about the results in the form of a management note. For this case study you will need the data set \dataset{trial.csv}\footnote{This data set is featured in Field, A. P. (2013). \textit{Discovering Statistics Using IBM SPSS Statistics (4th ed.).} London: Sage.} from the online resources. The case you will be working on this week is the following: \\

\textit{You and your team work for a research company that specializes in medial trials, and you have been asked to analyze the results of a trial about the effectiveness of Viagra. The current experiment is set up in the following manner: three groups of men have been given different doses of Viagra and their libido -and that of their partner- was measured over the course of one week. The experiment aimed to prove that there was an increase in libido as a result of the administered Viagra. Thus, the researchers are specifically interested in whether the Viagra treatment is related a higher libido than the placebo treatment.} \\

Write a small (less than two page) report to the client's management where you provide your insights and recommendations. The report should describe your analysis and how you arrived at your conclusions. It should at least contain the following points: \\

\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\blacksquare$] A short introduction about the topic of the report and why it is relevant for the client.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] A description of each variable in the data set, including what it represents and what measurement level it is.  
    \item[$\blacksquare$] A visualization of the difference in means between the test subjects, split by the different doses they received.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] A statistical formulation of the hypotheses that you intent to investigate, and what parameters are involved.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] A test of the difference in means between the different doses of the medicine.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] On the basis of the results, your answer to the question(s) posed by the client and an explanation of how you arrived at this answer.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] (optional) An extended analysis where you take into account the partner's libido, including an additional explanation of these results. A statement about the robustness of the results from the previous analysis.
\end{itemize}
