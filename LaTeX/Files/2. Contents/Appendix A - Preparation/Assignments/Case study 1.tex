In this case study you can work in groups (max. 4 students) to perform a statistical analysis in \texttt{R}, write a small report, and present the results to your client. For this case study you will need the data set \dataset{shaving.csv} from the online resources. The case you will be working on this week is the following: \\

\textit{Your team is working in the advisory department of a Big 4 Accounting firm that has been hired by a client to gain insight about their consumer population. The client in question is a company that produces shaving products, and they have already asked a random sample of 300 customers to provide a rating of their flagship product. Other than giving a rating of the product, the respondents were also asked about their highest education and in what sector they are currently employed. The client's management wants to specifically know what category of customers rate their product the highest.} \\

Write a small report to the client's management where you give your insights and recommendations. The report should describe your analysis and how you arrived at your conclusions. It should at least contain the following points: \\

\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\blacksquare$] A short introduction about the reason and topic of the report.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] A description of each variable in the \dataset{shaving.csv} data set, including what it represents and what its measurement level is. 
    \item[$\blacksquare$] A table containing the descriptive statistics for the rating in the sample of customers, split by the respondents' gender. Report, only where meaningful, the frequencies or means for each variable. Discuss what you can learn from this table. 
    \item[$\blacksquare$] For the highest rating gender, a table containing the descriptive statistics for the rating in the sample of customers, split by education level. Discuss what you can learn from this table. 
    \item[$\blacksquare$] For the highest rating gender and education combination, a table containing the descriptive statistics for the rating in the sample of customers, split by job sector. Discuss what you can learn from this table. 
    \item[$\blacksquare$] For the highest rating gender, education, and job combination, report the mean, median, and mode of the rating. Using these measures, describe the distribution of the rating in this particular category of customers. Discuss what observations you can make from this distribution with respect to skewness. 
    \item[$\blacksquare$] An argumentation about whether you think this sample is reliable enough (or not) to make a good decision about all the customers of the company.
    \item[$\blacksquare$] On the basis of your results, the answer to the question(s) posed by the client's management and an explanation of how you arrived at this answer.
\end{itemize}
