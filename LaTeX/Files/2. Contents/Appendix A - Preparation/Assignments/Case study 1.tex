In this case study you may work in groups (max. 4 students) to perform a statistical analysis in \texttt{R}, write a small report, and present the results to your client. For this case study you will need the data set \dataset{shaving.csv} from the online resources. The case you will be working on this week is the following: \\

\textit{Your team is working in the advisory department of a Big 4 Accounting firm that has been hired by a client to gain insight about their consumer population. The client in question is a company that produces shaving products, and they have already asked a random sample of 300 customers to provide a rating of their flagship product. Other than giving a rating of the product, the participants were also asked about their highest education and in what sector they work. The client's management wants to specifically know what type of customers rate their product the highest.} \\

Write a small report to the client's management where you give your recommendations. The report should describe your analysis and how you arrived at your conclusions. It should at least contain the following points: \\

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A short introduction about the reason and topic of the report.
    \item What the variables in the data set represent on a practical level and what their measurement level is. 
    \item A table containing the descriptive statistics for the rating in the sample of customers, split by male or female. Report, only where meaningful, the frequencies or means for each variable. Discuss what observations you can make using this table. 
    \item For the highest scoring gender, a table containing the descriptive statistics for the rating in the sample of customers, split by education level.
    \item For the highest scoring education and gender, a table containing the descriptive statistics for the rating in the sample of customers, split by job sector. Discuss what observations you can make using this table. 
    \item For the highest scoring education and gender and job sector, report the mean, median, and mode of the rating. Using these measures, describe the distribution of the rating in this group. Discuss what observations you can make from this distribution. 
    \item An argumentation about whether you think this sample is reliable enough (or not) to make statements like this.
    \item Your answer to the question posed by the client's management.
\end{enumerate}
