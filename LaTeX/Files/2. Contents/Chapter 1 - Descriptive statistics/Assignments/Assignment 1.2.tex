\rassignment{Assignment 1.2: Descriptive statistics of small data sets in R}

This assignment assumes you opened a new script in the code editor in
\texttt{RStudio}. Write and run your own code to answer the following questions. \\

In R, a one-dimensional row of numbers is represented by a \rcode{vector}. \\

\question{
    1.2 a
}{
    Use the \rcode{c()} function to enter the numbers from assignment 1.1a in a new vector called \rcode{dataset1}. Next, run the following code in \texttt{R} and explain what you see.
}

\codeblock{View(dataset1)}

\hint{Hint 1.1: Check Part I of the R help for more information on how to make a \rcode{vector}.}

\question{
    1.2 b
}{
    Write and run your own code in R to find the \concept{mean}, \concept{mode}, \concept{median}, and \concept{range} for the vector \rcode{dataset1}. Compare your answers with those of assignment 1.1a.
}

\hint{Hint 1.2: Check part IV of the R help on page~\pageref{rhelp} for descriptive statistics functions.}
\hint{Hint 1.3: There is no \concept{mode} function in R, but you can find the mode in a frequency \rcode{table}.}
