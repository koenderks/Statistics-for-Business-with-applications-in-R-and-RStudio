% Welcome to the Statistics for Business with applications in R and RStudio workbook
% 
% If you want to add an assignment to the workbook, please proceed as explained below. 
% A template assignment can be found in Adding a new assignment -> Template assignment.
%
% 1. Create a new assignment in the folder of the corresponding chapter assignments
%    The chapter folders can be found under Files -> 2. Contents -> Chapter x -> Assignments
%    The assignments must be named in sequence to the other assignments.
%    For example, if you want to add an assignment to chapter 7, it should be named 
%    "Assignment 7.4.tex" since chapter 7 has three assignments.
%
% 2. Add the assignment.tex file to the corresponding chapter.tex file using the input function
%    e.g., \input{Files/2. Contents/Chapter 7 - Comparing proportions and 
%                   distributions/Assignments/Assignment 7.4}
%
% 3. Create answers for the assignment by extending the answer from the
%    corresponding chapter in e.g. Files -> 2. Contents -> Anwers -> Chapter 7
%
% 4. Please do a final check for unexpected page breaks throughout the entire document
