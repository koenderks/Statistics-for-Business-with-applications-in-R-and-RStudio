\section{Introduction to the workbook}

In this introduction some basic principles are defined that are followed throughout the workbook to guide you through discovering the business potential of statistics using \texttt{R}. Here follows a summation of the different sections that you will come across while working through the various chapters. \\

\bigskip

\textit{Learning objectives} \\

Every chapter has specific learning objectives that give you an initial impression about what you will learn in the assignments of that chapter. The learning objectives also provide a good measurement of your ability after finishing the chapter, since you can check whether you master the learning objectives. \\

The learning objectives are shown at the beginning of each chapter in a {\color{learningobjectives} \fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont \textbf{yellow}} box. \\

\textit{Exercises by hand} \\

\begin{minipage}{0.85\textwidth}
Fancy some mathematical exercise? When you see the icon to the right you know that you will be expected to perform calculations by hand (or by the use of a simple calculator). For example, you may get asked to calculate the mean of a small data set for an assignment.

\textit{Exercises in R} \\ 

\begin{minipage}{0.85\textwidth}
The icon to the right is shown when it is time to start programming in \texttt{R}. You may warm up your programming fingers, since you will be asked to write and run your own code in the assignments that follow.

\textit{Hints} \\

\begin{minipage}{0.85\textwidth}
When you see the icon to the right it means that you will be given a hint for that question. Hints can be useful if you do not know how to get started with an assignment. Pay close attention to these hints, as they may also guide your attention to important aspects that can be easily overlooked.

\textit{Statistical concepts} \\ 

Various important statistical concepts will present itself during the assignments. These statistical concepts are highlighted in \concept{red} and can be found all over the text of the assignments. When these concepts can be calculated, their formulas can often be found in the formula sheet on page~\pageref{formulasheet}. An example such an important statistical concept can be the mean. \\

\concept{mean} \\ 

\bigskip

\textit{Data sets} \\

The color \dataset{green} is used to indicate the name of a data set that can be found in the online resources accompanying this workbook. For example, you might be asked to read a data set into \texttt{R} for further use in an assignment. \\

\dataset{example.csv} \\

\bigskip 

\textit{R code} \\ 

\texttt{R} code in the assignments is displayed in \rcode{blue}. These short lines of kind of code are generally used in the assignments to highlight objects or variables that exist in the current \texttt{R} session. They might also provide information on certain functions to use on an \texttt{R} object. \\

\rcode{View(dataset)} \\ 

\bigskip

\textit{R code blocks} \\ 

\texttt{R} code blocks are used in the assignments to indicate \texttt{R} code that should to be run together. Copy this code into your script in \texttt{RStudio} and select all of the code to run at it at once. Be sure to do this at all times, as running these lines of code individually may influence your results drastically. \\

\codeblock{x <- c(1, 5, 8, 3) \\ mean(x) }
