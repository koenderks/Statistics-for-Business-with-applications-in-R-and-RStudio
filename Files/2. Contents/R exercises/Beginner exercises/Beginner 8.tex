Run the following code in \texttt{R}: \\
\\
\codeblock{g <- gl(4, 3)}
Is \rcode{g} a vector? (If not, what is it?) How can you check?
}

\question{
B 44
}{
Run the following code in \texttt{R}: \\
\\
\codeblock{v <- rep(c(\textquotesingle m\textquotesingle, \textquotesingle f\textquotesingle), 3)}
Encode the variable \rcode{v} as factor levels. How do you check whether you succeeded?
}

B 45
}{
Run the following code in \texttt{R}: \\
\\
\codeblock{x <- 0:10\%\%3}
