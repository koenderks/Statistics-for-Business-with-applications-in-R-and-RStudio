Run the following code in \texttt{R}: \\
\\
\codeblock{d <- data.frame(sex = c(\textquotesingle m\textquotesingle, \textquotesingle f\textquotesingle), \\
                \hspace*{90pt}Age = c(6.7, 6.5, 5.6, 5.4), \\
                \hspace*{90pt}var1 = c(9, 5, 4, 4), \\
                \hspace*{90pt}var2 = c(10, 5, 8, 4))}
