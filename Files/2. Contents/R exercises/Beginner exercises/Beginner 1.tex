\subsection{Creating and removing objects in the environment}

\question{
    B 1
}{
    Run the following code in \texttt{R}: \\
    
    \codeblock{a = b = 1\\
a = 2}

What happened? How do you know (which command)? How many objects did you create in your environment? Try assigning the values using the \rcode{<-} operator. Does the result differ from the result when you are using \rcode{=} to create the variables? 
}   

\question{
B 2
}{
Remove the variables\rcode{a} and \rcode{b} from your environment using the \rcode{rm()} function.
}

\question{
B 3
}{
Run the following code in \texttt{R}: \\
\\
\codeblock{apple <- banana <- lemon <- 1}
Remove all objects with an 'n' in the name.
}

\question{
B 4
}{
Run the following code in \texttt{R}: \\
\\
\codeblock{apples <- 5; pears <- 3; pineapples <- 6}
Then try the following code: \\
\\
\codeblock{apples + pineapples \\
apples + Pears
}
Why can't you add \rcode{apples} and \rcode{Pears}?
}

\question{
B 5
}{
Use \texttt{R} to compute the square root of 81 and store the result in \rcode{t1}. 
}

\question{
B 6
}{
Use \texttt{R} to compute 81 to the power a half and store the result in \rcode{t2}. 
}

\question{
B 7
}{
Use the \rcode{==} operator to check whether the contents of \rcode{t1} and \rcode{t2} are the same.
